    <p>
        Like you, I used to think the world was this great place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
        then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world
        where righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and if you're not willing to play by his rules,
        then you're gonna have to pay the price.
